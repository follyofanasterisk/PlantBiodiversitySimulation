# PlantBiodiversitySimulation
A simulation of immobile independent agents designed to test the hypothesis that poor soil results in increased biodiversity

This simulation is still in development (version 0.7.1 as of now), and it is far from being complete. Check out the roadmap [here](https://github.com/follyofanasterisk/PlantBiodiversitySimulation/wiki/Roadmap)!

Created using Avalonia and OpenTK
